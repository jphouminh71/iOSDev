## Description

  

This is the directory page for all the design patterns that you might find useful to use in future projects. Patterns are found from previous lecture slides along with "Design Pattern in Swift 5"

**Creational Patterns:** These patterns are concerned with the decoupling of creation of objects and their usage. Thus, we don't expose the creation of objects to the users. 

**Structural Patterns:** These patterns aim to take objects and classes into larger structures and to achieve new functionality. 

**Behavioral Patterns** These patterns are concerned with how objects exchange information with each other without adding unnecessary dependencies. We are more concerned here about the interaction of different objects in our system. 


**Where you left off:** You are going to implement the singleton pattern. Going to do the example from the OOP slides then doing one fromt he textbook 

  

## Implemented Patterns
**Creational Patterns**
* Singleton Pattern
	* 
**Structural Patterns**

**Behavioral Patterns**
* Observer
	* decouples objects interactions. Allows multiple objects to subscribe to an observable. For any object that is no longer needed to listen to the obserable you must make sure you unsubscribe or else ARC will fail. 
	* In reality, what you are going to want to use is the Notification Center because its a lot easier to work with than manually creating one.
